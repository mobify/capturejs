# capture.js

A library for capturing your DOM.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/mobify-capturejs.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/mobify-capturejs)

## How to use

Right now, there are no instructions on how to use capture.js standalone. Please
go to www.mobifyjs.com for information on how to use capturing.

## How to create and ship a change

First, install the dependancies:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Then, run the following command to watch and build the capture.js file as you
develop:

```bash
$(npm bin)/grunt serve
```

Make sure you've got mobifyjs-utils installed!

Then, do the following to ship the change:

* Make your code changes and create a pull-request
* Ensure the tests still work (`$(npm bin)/grunt test` and `$(npm bin)/grunt saucelabs`)
* Get your change reviewed and :+1:'ed

## Roadmap

- Add instructions on how to use capture.js stand-alone (currently
  capture.js is something that is integrated into mobify.js)

## Where to get help

Talk to Stella, Noah or John
